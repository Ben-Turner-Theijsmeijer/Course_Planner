FRHD*3290  Practicum I: Adult  Fall and Winter  (LEC: 3, LAB: 12)  [1.00]  
This course offers students an opportunity to participate in seminar and
supervised field placement in health and social service agencies. The
practicum and seminar will develop students' helping roles in agencies
and facilitate the integration and application of theoretical knowledge
from previous course work with practice. It will also provide opportunities
for students to work directly with individuals and/or groups and to
participate in on-going programs or services. Students wishing to enrol in
this course must consult with the instructor during the course selection
period.

BOT*3050  Plant Functional Ecology  Fall Only  (LEC: 3, LAB: 3)  [0.50]  
This course integrates fundamental and applied aspects of plant ecology,
focusing on the roles of functional traits, physiological mechanisms,
life history strategies, abiotic constraints, and biotic interactions in
influencing plant distribution and abundance. Specific topics include
physiological ecology, growth and allocation patterns, influence of
biotic and trophic interactions [pollinators, pathogens, herbivores,
competitors, mutualists, decomposers] on the structure and function of
plant communities, and effects of global environmental change. Labs will
include a field component that explores variation in functional aspects of
plants. This course is especially valuable for students interested in plant
or wildlife biology and environmental management.

CHEM*2060  Structure and Bonding  Fall Only  (LEC: 3, LAB: 1.5)  [0.50]  
This course introduces fundamental concepts related to molecular
and supramolecular structure, models of chemical bonding and
intermolecular interactions. Specific topics include: symmetry
operations, symmetry elements and point groups; chirality and polarity;
atomic electronic structure, ionization potential, electron affinity, and
electronegativity; electrostatic interactions, including permanent and
induced dipole moments; hydrogen-bonding; models of ionic bonding,
ionic solids, crystal structures, and defects; introductory quantum
mechanical concepts describing atomic structure and bonding; covalent
bonding models; introductory VB theory and MO theory.
