variety of manufacturing processes involved in industrial activities.
While most of the manufacturing processes are to be introduced during
the course, more emphasis will be given on those processes which are
more common in industry, namely material removal processes, casting,
and forming. In addition to introducing the various manufacturing
process, mathematical models and several empirical data and equations
describing the various manufacturing processes will be covered in order
to provide the students with a better understanding of the relations
between the parameters involved.",N/A,ENGG*2160,N/A,ENGG*2120,N/A,N/A,School of Engineering,Guelph
CIS*1300,Programming,Fall and Winter,0.5,"This course introduces problem-solving, programming and data
organization techniques required for applications using a general
purpose programming language. Topics include control structures,
data representation and manipulation, program logic, development
and testing. This course is intended for students who do not intend to
enroll in further CIS courses. If your degree requires further CIS courses,
