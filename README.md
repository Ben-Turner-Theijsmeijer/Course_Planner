# SPRINT 1

Goal: Find the pre-requisites for all undergraduate courses offered by the
University of Guelph and store them in an Excel spreadsheet.

# What's New

Several modules were introduced in this sprint to accomplish the various tasks:

1. Preprocessing the data
2. Parsing the preprocessed data into courses that are appended to a course_list dictionary
3. Saving the course_list dictionary to an excel spread sheet
4. Creating a command line menu to search through various courses located in the excel spread sheet

# Usage

This will run the main application logic 

```python3 app.py```


# SPRINT 2

Goal: Please create an Excel spreadsheet where a person can write in their completed and in
progress courses in different cells. One course per cell. Given the courses, use VBA to
generate courses they can take next (have the pre-requisites for) and show them in the
Excel spreadsheet.
